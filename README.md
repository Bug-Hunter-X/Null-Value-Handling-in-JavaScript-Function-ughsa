# Null Value Handling in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript: unexpected behavior or errors when encountering null values. The `foo` function in `bug.js` provides a good practice example of handling null values to avoid such problems.

## The Problem

JavaScript often lacks explicit null checks.  If a function receives null or undefined arguments and does not handle them properly, it may lead to errors such as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '...')` or unexpected results. 

## The Solution

The best approach is to explicitly check for null (and undefined if needed) at the beginning of the function. If null is detected, the function can return null, throw an error, use a default value, or handle the null value in an appropriate manner based on the function's logic. 

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` and observe the behavior with and without null inputs.
3. Compare with `bugSolution.js` to see how null values are handled effectively.
